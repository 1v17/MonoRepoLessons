# Lesson 05: Instructor Notes

## üéØ Teaching Objectives

This lesson demonstrates the evolution from tightly coupled UI testing to proper separation of concerns with model-based architecture. Students will understand both approaches and when to use each.

## üìã Lesson Flow (90 minutes)

### Phase 1: Introduction (15 minutes)
1. **Context Setting** (5 min)
   - Review previous lessons on testing
   - Introduce the "testing evolution" concept
   - Show the simple greeting app demo

2. **Learning Objectives** (10 min)
   - Explain the two testing approaches
   - Preview what students will build
   - Set expectations for architectural thinking

### Phase 2: DOM-Based Testing (25 minutes)
1. **Live Coding** (15 min)
   - Build the simple `App.tsx` component
   - Write first DOM test together
   - Show test execution and results

2. **Student Practice** (10 min)
   - Students write additional DOM tests
   - Focus on different user interactions
   - Discuss test patterns and queries

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Emphasize user-centric thinking
- Show how tests mirror user behavior
- Point out the simplicity and directness

### Phase 3: Identifying Limitations (10 minutes)
1. **Discussion** (5 min)
   - "What happens as our app grows?"
   - "What if business logic becomes complex?"
   - "How do we test edge cases efficiently?"

2. **Demo Problems** (5 min)
   - Show slow test execution
   - Demonstrate brittle tests when UI changes
   - Highlight difficulty testing complex scenarios

### Phase 4: Model-Based Architecture (30 minutes)
1. **Architecture Introduction** (10 min)
   - Explain separation of concerns
   - Show the model interface design
   - Discuss dependency injection pattern

2. **Live Refactoring** (15 min)
   - Extract business logic to `model.ts`
   - Refactor component to use model
   - Show how architecture enables testing

3. **Testing the Model** (5 min)
   - Write pure model tests
   - Demonstrate speed and simplicity
   - Show comprehensive edge case coverage

### Phase 5: Mocked UI Testing (10 minutes)
1. **Mocking Concepts** (5 min)
   - Explain why we mock dependencies
   - Show mock creation patterns
   - Discuss isolation benefits

2. **Live Coding** (5 min)
   - Write UI tests with mocked model
   - Show interaction verification
   - Compare with DOM tests

## üéì Student Activities

### Activity 1: DOM Test Writing (15 minutes)
Students write tests for:
- Enter key functionality
- Empty input handling
- Multiple name updates
- Input field clearing

### Activity 2: Model Design (10 minutes)
Students design their own model interface for a different app (e.g., counter, todo item)

### Activity 3: Mock Creation (10 minutes)
Students create mocks for their designed model and write basic UI tests

## üîç Assessment Checkpoints

### Understanding Check 1 (After DOM Testing)
**Question:** "What are the pros and cons of testing the UI directly?"
**Expected Answer:** 
- Pros: Tests real user experience, catches integration issues
- Cons: Slower, brittle to UI changes, hard to test complex logic

### Understanding Check 2 (After Model Introduction)
**Question:** "Why separate business logic from UI logic?"
**Expected Answer:**
- Easier to test business rules
- Faster test execution
- Better maintainability
- Independent evolution of concerns

### Understanding Check 3 (After Mocking)
**Question:** "When would you use mocked vs real dependencies in tests?"
**Expected Answer:**
- Mocked: Fast unit tests, isolated component testing
- Real: Integration tests, end-to-end workflows

## üö® Common Student Struggles

### 1. "Why make it more complex?"
**Response:** Start with simple examples, then show how complexity grows. Emphasize that good architecture pays off over time.

### 2. "Mocking seems like cheating"
**Response:** Explain that mocking enables focused testing. Show how it complements, not replaces, integration tests.

### 3. "Which approach should I always use?"
**Response:** Emphasize context-dependent decisions. Show the decision framework from the guide.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Setup Notes

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ installed
- Basic React knowledge
- Understanding of Jest basics

### Common Setup Issues
1. **Jest configuration:** Students may struggle with jsdom setup
2. **Import errors:** TypeScript module resolution can be tricky
3. **Mock syntax:** Jest mocking syntax is not intuitive

### Quick Fixes
```bash
# If tests don't run
npm install --save-dev @types/jest

# If DOM queries fail
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom

# If TypeScript complains
# Add to tsconfig.json: "types": ["jest", "@testing-library/jest-dom"]
```

## üìä Success Metrics

Students should be able to:
1. ‚úÖ Write basic DOM tests using React Testing Library
2. ‚úÖ Identify when DOM testing becomes problematic
3. ‚úÖ Extract business logic into testable models
4. ‚úÖ Create and use mocks for UI testing
5. ‚úÖ Explain the trade-offs between approaches

## üîÑ Extension Activities

### For Advanced Students
1. **Performance Testing:** Measure and compare test execution times
2. **Coverage Analysis:** Use Jest coverage reports to compare approaches
3. **Real-World Refactoring:** Take a complex component and apply model separation

### For Struggling Students
1. **Guided Practice:** Pair programming with instructor
2. **Simplified Examples:** Start with even simpler components
3. **Visual Aids:** Draw architecture diagrams together

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **Start Simple:** DOM testing is a great entry point
2. **Evolve Architecture:** Good testing drives good design
3. **Context Matters:** Different approaches for different situations
4. **Balance is Key:** Use both approaches strategically

*Remember: The goal is not to convince students that one approach is always better, but to give them tools to make informed decisions based on their specific context.*
